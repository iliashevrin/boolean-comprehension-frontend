# boolean-comprehension-frontend
This is the frontend node project of the experimental framework described in the paper "What Properties Affect Boolean Formula Comprehension in Formal Specifications?" (TOSEM 2025).
# Running and Testing
To run the frontend, clone it into your machine and run `npm run dev`.

The project is connected to the corresponding backend node project at [https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-backend](https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-backend), that was deployed during the experiment execution as a Render project and served at [https://boolean-formula-comprehension.onrender.com](https://boolean-formula-comprehension.onrender.com). Parallelly, the frontend was deployed as a Vercel project and served at [https://boolean-formula-comprehension-front.vercel.app/](https://boolean-formula-comprehension-front.vercel.app/).

You can test the project locally on your machine by running the backend according to the instructions at [https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-backend](https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-backend) changing the url to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
